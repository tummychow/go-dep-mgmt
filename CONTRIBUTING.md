# Contributing

Any contributions are welcome, notably:

- any high-profile Go projects that are using a given dependency management tool (use your discretion for "high-profile". I usually call it on 1000+ stars, assuming it's on GitHub.). If you can find a discussion between project maintainers about what tool to choose, that's a great bonus, because it tells us what those gophers are thinking about in their decisions.
- strengths and weaknesses of the tools you've used, derived from *actual* experience. We're talking Stack Overflow's "good subjective" here. Unfounded ranting about a tool's particular CLI or design decisions is thoroughly unwelcome. This list is supposed to help gophers as a community!
- Objective summary of tool documentation. This is written from the standpoint of a gopher who's asking: "I'm not new to Go, but now I'm in (or starting) a big project, and I need dependency management. If I started using `insert-tool-here` right now, what would I have to do?"
- more dependency managers! List them all! (Right now I star any dependency manager that's trending on GitHub so I can come back to it later. That's how I found the items on the current list.)
- good articles and blog posts on Go dependency management, things that are worth reading for someone more deeply interested in the subject

## To maintainers of tools

If you maintain a tool and you see factual inaccuracies, **correct me**. (*To save one from a mistake is a gift of paradise.* - Stilgar) Open an issue. I have nothing better to do all day than react to notifications on GitHub, so it's not like I'll leave you hanging.

If you'd like to keep the summary for your own tool up to date, just ask for collaborator permissions. The implicit expectation is that you don't go messing with the descriptions for other tools unless you have something honest to add there, but we're all cool people so I'm sure we can trust one another.
